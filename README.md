# External Stock

#### A collection of tools that I use in my daily work.

The first tool is used to synchronize the amount of inventory available from our suppliers.
Depending on the supplier, inventories are retrieved from an xml or csv file hosted on their servers or scraped from a website. 

We needed a tool that would quickly collect all available products from our suppliers and create one simple file with the product code and stock size. 
#
The second tool is used to monitor the stock quantities of available individual items in product sets. 

This tool was developed in response to the limitations of Asecco Wapro's inventory program.
#
The next tool is used to convert product specifications (e.g., weight, dimensions) from the format stored in Asecco Wapro's warehouse program to the Shoper - E-Commerce Platform.
